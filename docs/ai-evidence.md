This didn't function correctly sadly, even after going back and forth. 

However, it gave me a general template to work from, which you can see in all the Menu tests, utilising the provideInput function was especially useful.

Sadly I couldn't figure out how to properly incorporate more mocking in these tests, so they're possibly more tightly coupled than I would like.

### Demonstration for use in regular test cases
