## Address Book Challenge - Pitch

### Introduction

As the world grows and becomes more complex, our individual network is also expanding rapidly. With this in mind, it can be hard to keep up with everyone we come across who wants to stay in touch.
Just because we don't speak to someone for months or even years, doesn't mean we don't want to catchup with them. This is especially true for family and friends, but imagine a scenario in which you've
been made redundant and are looking for work; it would be helpful to know all those contacts you've made along the way who could help connect you to a new adventure, wouldn't it?
That's where the DFCorp's Address Book comes in! This software will allow users to make sense of their massive network of family, friends and colleagues in one easy place.

### Benefits of this software...

- The ability to see all your contacts in one place.
- Searching through contacts, to find that one person you swore you met...
  - You can search by their name, number or email, so you don't have to worry in case you forget one!
- Adding new contacts with just their name, phone number and email address, a simple and quick process.
- Seeing your contacts alphabetically
- Removing people from your contacts, means your book doesn't get so cluttered.
- Ultimately, offload the brain power of remembering everyone you've met onto the DF Address Book!

### Problem? Solved!

**Less brain work** - As you can see with the list above, the issue of remembering everyone you come across is a thing of the past.

**Long emails** - If those people have extensive email addresses, with this Address Book you only have to type it in once, and we'll remember it for you.

**Alphabetical searching** - Sometimes you might only remember that the person's name began with a "T", with our search it'll be easy to find out who that is.

### Potential Risk

**Lack of Security** - The user's address book holds a lot of people's personal information, whilst we've been careful not to allow anything too incrementing, if someone nefarious gets
their hands on someone's address book then there is currently no security in place to stop that person going through the info of their loved ones.

### Benefits to and responsibility of the business

- **More integrated into daily lives** - This product signifies to users that we want to offer them something of true value; helping them connect with their loved ones more easily. A service they will likely need every day.
  
- **Becoming more trusted** - Allowing user's to have an address book means that all their valuable data is trusted with us, data that they will regularly need to access and update.

- **Future Integration** - This Address Book could become fundamental to our customer's lives, and with it, if we want to expand into social media or beyond in the future. We already have a place for our customers to easily transfer their data from.

### Conclusion

Utilising this Address Book and user's habits through the data they provide us, will signify in what direction we'd like to go in the future with our software.
For example, if people are generally putting in details and connecting with those around the world, then we understand our reach to be more global.
How often they access the address book will tell us how valuable the service we are providing is as well.
In terms of the business, being integral to the daily lives of our users means they're putting more and more trust in us, so that when we expand our range of software,
there is already an installed user-base ready to engage in whatever we put out. Future apps could be integrated into the address book or vice versa on top of this.
